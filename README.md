Sarah wants to ensure she gets a well-rounded view of current events by considering multiple perspectives. She visits the Libel website and creates an account. Upon logging in, she is greeted with a clean and intuitive interface. Sarah starts by using the advanced search functionality to find articles related to a specific topic she's interested in.</br></br>
Libel presents Sarah with a list of articles from various sources, including mainstream media outlets, independent journalists, and opinion pieces.
